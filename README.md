## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With the explosion of online information, modern people can easily access different fields of knowledge and develop an interest in areas they may not be familiar with. With the gradual maturation of online education platforms, there is a great deal of enthusiasm for people to try out new knowledge online. However, with the variety of courses available on the internet, it is easy to be overwhelmed and unable to choose the one that best suits their background and interests. To help people have an easy and happy start to their e-learning experience, this project developed a course recommender for the Coursera education platform. The objective is to select the best courses that match the user's interests from the vast educational resources and recommend them to the user, helping the user to make the proper choice more easily and quickly. After the user selects one of the courses, the system will calculate the similarity among the courses and keep making recommenders to our users.

Three kinds of reasoning systems—content-based reasoning, similarity-based reasoning, and knowledge-based reasoning—are used by the product. We carefully observed the courses’ details and extracted a set of features from them to thoroughly describe Coursera’s course. The system also has a user preference setting page for collecting and generalising user preferences into the user profile. Based on the user's profile, the system will recommend the top ten closest match courses against the course descriptions to the user. Besides, the similarity between every two courses is pre-calculated considering all the set of course features and is loaded into the system. Each time the user selects a course of interest, the system will recommend ten similar courses, ranked by their distance. Each element in the set of features disparately contributes to the similarity calculation. Our team assigned different weights to different features based on our research and knowledge, to perform the similarity calculation.

The knowledge base for this project is collected from open source Coursera Course Dataset published on Kaggle, combined with further detailed course information scraped from Coursera's official website. Data preparation and data transformation, such as data cleaning and feature engineering, are applied to the raw data. All processed course features are stored in an SQL database. According to the attribution of similarity-based reasoning, the similarity between every two classes is pre-calculated. The top 10 similar courses’ id are then stored in the SQL database.

With the Coursera Course Recommender System, one can approach a suitable set of courses in a short time, saving a lot of unnecessary time in browsing through numerous web pages and picking a satisfying course. It allows you to focus more on the course's content and learning itself.

## SECTION 5 : USER GUIDE

`Refer to appendix <Installation & User Guide> in project report at Github Folder: ProjectReport`

### To run this system on your computer

#### Requirements

Enter folder:
> $ cd SystemCode/course-recommendation-main

Install dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Django web server:
> python manage.py makemigrations

> python manage.py migrate

> python manage.py runserver

> **Go to URL using web browser** http://127.0.0.1:8000/

#### User Guide

1. Installation Guide

   As the development and debugging of this project is based on the Windows operating system, we strongly recommend that you use Windows to run our system. All the following guides are based on Windows.

   + Step1: Download and install Anaconda

     You can skip this step if you have downloaded and installed anaconda.
     Anaconda is an open source distribution of Python and R that simplifies package management systems and deployment. You can download Anaconda from their website and install it by following official instruction.

   + Step2: Create a new conda environment

     As a large number of third party Python packages will be used in this project, you should create a new conda environment to avoid conflicts between packages.

     Type in conda prompt: conda create -n your env name python=3.8

   + Step3: Clone or download our system from Github

     You can use git command to clone our project from Github.
     Type in git prompt: git clone https://github.com/Theno-Chan/CourseraCourseRecommender.git

     Or you can directly download system code from Github.

   + Step4: Install the Required Python Packages

     You need to change directory to the Clone Repository folder or download folder. 

     Type in cmd: cd /to/the/right/folder

     And run this command in cmd: pip install -r requirements.txt

   + Step5: Run web server

     Run this command in cmd: python manage.py runserver

     After running, you can open your web browser and type 127.0.0.1:8000 in the address bar. Then you will be directed to the index page!
